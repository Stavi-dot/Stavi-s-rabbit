        <div class="Description">
           <P>Rabbits are small, furry mammals with long ears, short fluffy tails, and strong, large hind legs. They have 2 pairs of sharp incisors (front teeth), one pair on top and one pair on the bottom. They also have 2 peg teeth behind the top incisors. Their teeth are specifically adapted for gnawing and grow continuously throughout their lives.
           Using their powerful hind legs, rabbits move by hopping. They have 4 toes on their hind feet that are long and webbed to keep them from spreading apart as they jump. Their front paws have 5 toes each. Some species of rabbit can reach speeds of 35 to 45 miles per hour (56 to 72 kilometers per hour). Young rabbits seem to walk instead of hop.
           Rabbits vary in color and size, ranging in weight from 2 to 16 pounds (1 to 7 kilograms), depending on breed. Pet rabbits that have been well taken care of and spayed or neutered early in life have a life expectancy of 8 to 12 years.
